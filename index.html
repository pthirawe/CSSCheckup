            Who does she think she is? That girl has tangled with <br>
            the wrong man! No one says "no" to Gaston! <br>

            Heh heh. Darn right. <br>

            Dismissed! Rejected! Publicly Humiliated! Why, it's
            more than I can bear. <br>

            More beer? <br>

            What for? Nothing helps. I'm disgraced. <br>

            Who, you? Never! Gaston, you've got to pull yourself together.
        </p>
        <p class="verse">
            Gosh it disturbs me to see you, Gaston <br>
            Looking so down in the dumps <br>
            Every guy here'd love to be you, Gaston <br>
            Even when taking your lumps <br>
            There's no man in town as admired as you <br>
            You're ev'ryone's favorite guy <br>
            Ev'ryone's awed and inspired by you <br>
            And it's not very hard to see why
        </p>
        <p class="chorus">
            No one's slick as Gaston <br>
            No one's quick as Gaston <br>
            No one's neck's as incredibly thick as Gaston <br>
            For there's no man in town half as manly <br>
            Perfect, a pure paragon <br>
            You can ask any Tom, Dick or Stanley <br>
            And they'll tell you whose team they prefer to be on <br>
            <br>
            No one's been like Gaston <br>
            A king pin like Gaston <br>
            No one's got a swell cleft in his chin like Gaston <br>
            As a specimen, yes, I'm intimidating <br>
            My- what a guy, that Gaston
        </p>
        <p class="verse">
            No one fights like Gaston <br>
            Douses lights like Gaston <br>
            In a wrestling match nobody bites like Gaston <br>
            For there's no one as burly and brawny <br>
            As you see I've got biceps to spare <br>
            Not a bit of him's scraggly or scrawny <br>
            (That's right!) <br>
            And ev'ry last inch of me's covered with hair
